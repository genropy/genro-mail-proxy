# Claude Code Project Policies

## Language Policy
- All code, comments, and commit messages must be written in English
- Documentation should be in English unless explicitly requested otherwise

## Git Commit Authorship
- Never include Claude as a co-author in commits
- Remove the "Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>" line from commit messages

## Project Status: Beta
This project is currently in **beta** status. While in beta:

- Documentation should **not** reference or discuss migration paths from previous versions
- Backward compatibility is **not** a concern and should not be maintained
- Breaking changes are acceptable and do not require special consideration
- Focus on stability and feature completeness rather than compatibility with older versions

Once the project exits beta status, these policies will be revised to include:
- Migration documentation for users upgrading from beta
- Backward compatibility considerations
- Deprecation notices for breaking changes
